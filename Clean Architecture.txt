step-1
create a blank solution name it with HR.LeaveManagement
step-2
create folders
             src
			    API
				Core
				Infrastructure
				UI
			 test
step-3
     create a new class library (name domain) project in Core folder -> HR.LeaveManagement.Domain

step-4
     create few class in domain project. 

step-5
      create a folder name as Common under domain project for few common entity
	  
setp-6 
      create a baseEntity class

setp-7
	  create respective repository interfaces for each domain which implement IGenericRepository interface
	  
setp-8
	  install automapper in application with dependancy injection. create a folder under Application project named as profiles.

step-9
	  create a class with name MappingProfile which could be the configuration file of the auto mapper;
step-10
	   create DTOs Folders under Applications Project. Add dto class for each domain.
step-11
       create mappingProfile class and configure
step-12
	   ApplicationServicesRegistration Added to Aplication and register auto mapper.
step-13
      agian install MediatR in Application project and configure MediatR.

step-14
	  Next step we need to implement CQRS partten. Command ,Query (Command and Query Responsibility Segregation)
step-15
	  Add a folder called Features and under the Feature folder add folder for each domain type. 
	  (you could have add every thing under one folder due to cleanness i have implemented every thing on separate folder structure)
step-16
       add all the folder structure 
	   
	   the folder structure would be like : Features -> DomainType->Handlers-> Commands,Queries
	                                                              ->Request-> Commands,Queries
																  
step-17
	   Implemented all releated class for a get method for a demo type.
	   
step-18
		moved all the DTOs are moved to respective folders.

step-19 
        added few Dtos in Dtos folder under application.
